# Java OOP Class Programs

This repo contains my college Java OOP practice code (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.).

## How to run
- Requires JDK 17+  
- Compile: `javac -d out src/**/*.java`  
- Run (example): `java -cp out oops.Main`  *(use your package + class name)*

## Folders
- `src/oops/` – OOP topics (each program in its own file)
