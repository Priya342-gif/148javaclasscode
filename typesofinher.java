// Hereâ€™s a short and easy explanation of types of inheritance in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):

// Single Inheritance â€“ A class inherits from only one parent class.
// ðŸ‘‰ Example: Son inherits from Father.

// Multilevel Inheritance â€“ A class inherits from another class, which itself is a child of another class.
// ðŸ‘‰ Example: Grandson â†’ Son â†’ Father.

// Hierarchical Inheritance â€“ Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.
// ðŸ‘‰ Example: Brother and Sister inherit from Father.

// Multiple Inheritance â€“ A class inherits from more than one parent class. (Directly not supported in Java, but possible in C++ and via interfaces in Java).
// ðŸ‘‰ Example: Child inherits from Father + Mother.

// Hybrid Inheritance â€“ Combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., Hierarchical + Multiple).
